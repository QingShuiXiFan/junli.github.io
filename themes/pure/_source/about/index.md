Hello! I am Jun Li. A **Software Engineer**, Website Maintainer, and **Traveler**.

I keep training myself to be a dedicated and creative software engineer. I love exploring beautiful algorithms and share them with others. And I'd like to join a collaborative team and work with high-efficiency. What's more, to travel around the world is my ultimate dream.
